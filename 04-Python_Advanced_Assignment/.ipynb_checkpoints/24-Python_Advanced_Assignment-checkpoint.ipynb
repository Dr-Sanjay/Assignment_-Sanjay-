    "Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. The goal of doing this might be to import different parts of the module into different namespaces. For example, you might want to import the `math` module to access the `pi` constant in one namespace, and the `sin()` function in another namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "A situation where this might be beneficial is if you are writing a program that uses both the `pi` constant and the `sin()` function, but you want to avoid name clashes. By importing the `math` module twice, you can assign the `pi` constant to a different name in each namespace, such as `my_pi` and `your_pi`. This will prevent the two names from clashing, and you will be able to use both the `pi` constant and the `sin()` function in your program."
