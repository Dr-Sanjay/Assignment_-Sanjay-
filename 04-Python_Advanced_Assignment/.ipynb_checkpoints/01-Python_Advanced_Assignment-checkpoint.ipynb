    "* **Encapsulate data and behavior:** Classes encapsulate data and behavior, which means that they keep the data and code that represent an object together. This makes code more organized and easier to understand.\n",
    "* **Reuse code:** Classes can be reused to create new objects. This makes it easier to develop large and complex applications.\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** Classes can be used to abstract away the details of how an object works. This makes code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "* **Polymorphism:** Classes can be used to create polymorphic objects. This means that objects of different classes can have the same methods. This can be used to create more flexible and extensible code."
