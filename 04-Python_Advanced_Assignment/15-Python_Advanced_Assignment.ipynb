    "Python 3.8 was released on October 14, 2019. It includes a number of new features, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **New data types:** The `match` and `case` statements were added to Python 3.8. These statements allow you to match patterns in strings and other iterables.\n",
    "* **New syntax:** The `f-strings` were added to Python 3.8. These strings allow you to insert variables and expressions into strings using a format string syntax.\n",
    "* **New functions:** The `sorted()` function was updated to allow you to sort objects by multiple keys. The `zip()` function was also updated to allow you to zip objects of different lengths.\n",
    "* **New modules:** The `importlib.metadata` module was added to Python 3.8. This module allows you to access the metadata of Python modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete list of new features in Python 3.8, you can refer to the official release notes: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html."
