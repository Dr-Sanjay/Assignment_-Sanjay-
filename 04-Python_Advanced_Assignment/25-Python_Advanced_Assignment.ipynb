    "import ta\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ta` module is not installed by default, so the `import ta` statement will not work. To make the `import ta` statement work, you need to install the `ta` module first.\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the `ta` module is installed, you can use the `import ta` statement to import the module.\n",

    "Here is how indirect importing works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `import ta` statement looks for a module called `ta` in the current directory.\n",
    "2. If the `ta` module is not found in the current directory, the `import ta` statement looks for a module called `ta` in the Python standard library.\n",
    "3. If the `ta` module is not found in the Python standard library, the `import ta` statement raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use indirect importing to import modules from other directories. To do this, you need to specify the full path to the directory where the module is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code imports the `ta` module from the `/path/to/ta` directory:\n",
