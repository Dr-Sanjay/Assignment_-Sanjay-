    " 💡 1. Roman to Integer\n",
    "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.\n",
    "```\n",
    "SymbolValue\n",
    "I             1\n",
    "V             5\n",
    "X             10\n",
    "L             50\n",
    "C             100\n",
    "D             500\n",
    "M             1000\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.\n",
    "Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n",
    "- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.\n",
    "- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.\n",
    "- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n",
    "Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"III\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: III = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"LVIII\"\n",
    "Output: 58\n",
    "Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- 1 <= s.length <= 15\n",
    "- s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').\n",
    "- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].\n",

    " 💡 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",
    "Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"abcabcbb\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The answer is \"abc\", with the length of 3.\n",

    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"pwwkew\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The answer is \"wke\", with the length of 3.\n",
    "Notice that the answer must be a substring, \"pwke\" is a subsequence and not a substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- 0 <= s.length <= 50000\n",
    "- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces. \n",
    " 💡 3. Majority Element\n",
    "Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.\n",
    "The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.\n",

    " 💡 4. Group Anagram\n",
    "Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: strs = [\"eat\",\"tea\",\"tan\",\"ate\",\"nat\",\"bat\"]\n",
    "Output: [[\"bat\"],[\"nat\",\"tan\"],[\"ate\",\"eat\",\"tea\"]]\n",

    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 1\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: words = [\"i\",\"love\",\"leetcode\",\"i\",\"love\",\"coding\"], k = 2\n",
    "Output: [\"i\",\"love\"]\n",
    "Explanation: \"i\" and \"love\" are the two most frequent words.\n",
    "Note that \"i\" comes before \"love\" due to a lower alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
