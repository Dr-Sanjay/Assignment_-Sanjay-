    "3. Model Validation:\n",
    "   a. Implement cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a regression model for predicting housing prices.\n",
    "   b. Perform model validation using different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for a binary classification problem.\n",
    "   c. Design a model validation strategy that incorporates stratified sampling to handle imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deployment Strategy:\n",
    "   a. Create a deployment strategy for a machine learning model that provides real-time recommendations based on user interactions.\n",
    "   b. Develop a deployment pipeline that automates the process of deploying machine learning models to cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure.\n",
    "   c. Design a monitoring and maintenance strategy for deployed models to ensure their performance and reliability over time.\n"
