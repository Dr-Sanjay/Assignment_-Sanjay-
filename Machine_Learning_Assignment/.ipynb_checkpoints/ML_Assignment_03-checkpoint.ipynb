    "Two machine learning applications in the business world include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Fraud Detection:** ML algorithms can analyze large volumes of data, such as financial transactions, to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity. By continuously learning from new data, ML models can adapt to evolving fraud patterns and help businesses detect and prevent fraudulent behavior.\n",
