    "The key tasks involved in getting ready to work with machine learning modeling are:  \n",
    "    * **Data collection:** This involves collecting the data that will be used to train and test the machine learning model. The data can be collected from a variety of sources, such as surveys, experiments, or historical records.  \n",
    "    * **Data preparation:** This involves cleaning, formatting, and transforming the data so that it is in a format that can be used by the machine learning model. This may involve removing duplicate data, filling in missing values, or converting categorical data to numerical data.  \n",
    "    * **Model selection:** This involves choosing the right machine learning model for the data. There are many different machine learning models available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The model that is chosen will depend on the specific problem that is being solved and the characteristics of the data.  \n",
    "    * **Model training:** This involves training the machine learning model on the data. This is done by feeding the data to the model and allowing it to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable.  \n",
    "    * **Model evaluation:** This involves evaluating the performance of the machine learning model on a holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is a set of data that was not used to train the model. The model's performance on the holdout dataset is an indication of how well it will perform on new data.  \n",
    "    * **Model deployment:** This involves deploying the machine learning model to production. This may involve creating a web application or a software package that uses the model to make predictions."
