    "A target function, in the context of machine learning, refers to the objective or goal that a model aims to optimize or approximate. It represents the relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target) that the model is trying to learn. The target function captures the underlying patterns or mapping within the data and is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

    "The fitness or performance of a target function is typically evaluated by measuring how well it performs on a specific task or objective. This assessment is done by comparing the predictions made by the model using the target function with the actual values in the training or test data. Various evaluation metrics are used depending on the nature of the problem, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, etc. The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the problem being addressed."

The most common reason for underfitting is when the model is too basic or lacks the necessary complexity to represent the underlying data distribution.\n",

It refers to the trade-off between a model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data (low variance). A model with high bias tends to underfit the training data, while a model with high variance tends to overfit the training data. Achieving the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for building models that generalize well."

Eager learners are characterized by upfront model building and quick prediction once trained.\n",

Instead of building a general model, a lazy learner retains the entire training data and directly uses it for prediction. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is an example of a lazy learner. Lazy learners have a low training time but require more computation during prediction as they need to search and compare with the training instances at the time of making predictions."
