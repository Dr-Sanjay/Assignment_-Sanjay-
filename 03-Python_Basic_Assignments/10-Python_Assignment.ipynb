This allows for safer deletion, as the files can be restored if needed. The `send2trash()` function takes the path of the file or directory as an argument.\n",

The `shutil.rmtree()` function is used to recursively delete a directory and its contents, including all files and subdirectories. It permanently deletes the files and directories, bypassing the system trash or recycle bin. The `os.remove()` function is used to delete a single file."
