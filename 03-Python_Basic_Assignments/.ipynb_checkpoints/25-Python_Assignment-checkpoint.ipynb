    "\n",
    "- Generators are a type of iterator. They are defined using a special kind of function called a generator function. Generator functions use the `yield` keyword to produce a series of values one at a time. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over. The `yield` statement pauses the execution of the generator function and yields a value to the caller. The next time the generator is iterated, it resumes execution from where it left off.\n",

It takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable to apply it to. The function is applied to each element of the iterable, and the results are lazily computed as they are requested. The `map()` function returns an iterator object, and to get the results as a list, you need to explicitly convert it using `list()`.\n",
