    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Code Reusability**: Functions allow you to define a block of reusable code that can be called multiple times from different parts of the program. This promotes modular and organized code, reducing redundancy and making the codebase more maintainable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Abstraction and Modularity**: Functions help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Each function can focus on a specific task, making the code easier to understand, test, and debug. Functions also promote code readability and abstraction by encapsulating implementation details behind a function name and parameters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Code Organization**: Functions allow you to logically structure and organize your code into smaller, self-contained units. This improves code maintainability, readability, and makes it easier for multiple developers to collaborate on a project.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Code Maintainability**: Functions facilitate code maintenance and updates. If you need to make changes to a particular functionality, you only need to modify the function's code once, and the changes will be reflected wherever the function is called.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Code Testing**: Functions make it easier to write unit tests for specific functionalities. You can test each function individually to ensure it behaves correctly, simplifying the debugging process and increasing the reliability of your code."

Functions are created using the `def` statement and can have parameters, a function body, and a return statement (optional).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Function Call**: A function call is the act of invoking or executing a function. It is the point in the program where the function's code is executed. When you call a function, you use the function name followed by parentheses and any required arguments. The function call passes control from the current location in the program to the function, and after the function finishes executing, the control is returned to the point immediately after the function call.\n"
