    "   - Excel spreadsheets can store multiple sheets within a single file, while CSV files are limited to a single sheet.\n",
    "   - Excel supports various formatting options, such as cell styles, colors, fonts, and formulas, whereas CSV files only contain plain text data.\n",
    "   - Excel provides built-in features for data analysis, sorting, filtering, and charting, making it more suitable for complex data manipulation.\n",
    "   - Excel supports cell references and formulas, enabling dynamic calculations and linking between cells, which CSV files cannot do.\n",
    "   - Excel allows for password protection and restricted access to the spreadsheet, providing enhanced security features that are not available in CSV files."
